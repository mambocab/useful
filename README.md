# Words to Live By

I can't pretend to be particularly good at this. But I've been lucky enough to come across some good ideas.

## For Everyone

Let food rest after heating or cooking -- a little longer than you think you need to. This goes double for the microwave. I know it hurts. I'm sorry.

Writing is thinking. Be wary of tools that claim to help you spend less attention or effort on it.

## For Programmers

Use dependency injection earlier than you think you need to.

Dependency injection is just parameter passing, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

Method calls are just curried functions. Hiding that are dangerous. (This is one of the things that makes Python as good as it is.)
